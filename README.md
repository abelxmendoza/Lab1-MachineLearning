## Introduction

Machine Learning is a fascinating field that involves teaching machines to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. This lab serves as a hands-on introduction to various machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Basic knowledge of Python programming.
* Familiarity with fundamental machine learning concepts.
* Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
* It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this lab, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abelxmendoza/Lab1-MachineLearning.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Lab1-MachineLearning
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install
```

4. You can now start exploring the lab exercises and code samples.

## Lab Structure

The lab is organized into separate directories, each corresponding to a specific exercise or topic. Here's the directory structure:

* `data/`: Contains datasets used in the lab exercises.
* `exercises/`: Contains the code and Jupyter notebooks for each exercise.
